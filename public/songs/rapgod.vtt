00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.310
[Intro]
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.799
your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.230
Something's wrong, I can feel it (For six
minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.119
Just a feeling I've got, like something's
about to happen

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.200
But I don't know what if that means what I
think it means

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.830
We're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.750
taking any chances
(You are just what the doc ordered)

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.580
[Hook]
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.369
God
All my people from the front to the back nod,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.350
back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.050
to slapbox, slapbox
They said I rap like a robot, so call me rapbot

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.100
[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer must be

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.300
in my genes, I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it, got

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.920
a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.399
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his (nut-sack),

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.440
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell, syllables,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.370
kill-a-holic
(Kill em all with) this flippity dippity-hippity

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.620
hip-hop, you don't really wanna get into a
pissin' match wit' this rappity-rap

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.879
Packin' a mack in the back of the Ac, backpack
rap crap, yap-yap yackety-yack

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.589
And at the exact same time, I attempt these
lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin'

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.250
that
I'll still be able to break a mothafucking

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.609
table over the back of a couple of faggots
and crack it in half

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:12.009
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to
Aftermath after the fact

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.920
How could I not blow, all I do is drop F-bombs,
feel my wrath of attack

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.499
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's
a maxi pad

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:21.060
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.359
cause

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.990
[Hook]
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.429
God
All my people from the front to the back nod,

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.409
back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.249
to slapbox, slapbox
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.939
that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.249
immortality like I have got

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.069
[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.959
rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance, hit

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.450
the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but
shoot for the moon since

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.079
MC's get taken to school with this music cause
I use it

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.399
As a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme' now I lead
a new school full of students

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.419
Me, I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz,
2Pac, N-

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:54.649
W.A, Cube, Hey Doc, Ren Yella, Eazy, thank
you, they got Slim

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.130
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up
and be in a position

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.959
To meet Run DMC, and induct them into the
motherfuckin' Rock n'-

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.590
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.209
in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.140
alcohol of fame on the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.290
a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.930
are you thinking
Little gay lookin' boy

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.140
So gay I can barely say it with a straight
face looking, boy

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.040
You're witnessing a massacre like you're watching
a church gathering take place, looking boy

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.350
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say
looking, boy

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.640
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label everyday

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.210
looking, boy
Hey, lookin' boy, what you say looking boy

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.480
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre looking, boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.500
nobody for shit, get outta my face looking
boy

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.410
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
to keeping up with the same pace looking,

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.660
boy cause

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.770
[Hook]
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.890
God
All my people from the front to the back nod,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.730
back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.850
me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.640
Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.540
no Asgard, Asgard

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.270
[Verse 3]
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.510
I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.550
these bombs I'm toting
And I should not be woken, I'm the walking

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.950
dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie
floating

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.180
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle, we have nothing in

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.670
common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.760
and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.950
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize
what I do though

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.870
For good at least once in a while, so I wanna
make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.760
I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.870
people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.950
case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.290
lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.370
Was king of the underground, but I still rap
like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.840
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you
combine

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.090
Appeal with the skin color of mine, you get
too big and here they come tryin'

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.300
To censor you like that one line I said on
"I'm Back" from the Mathers LP 1 when I tried

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.440
to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.430
and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.540
as big as I was, but I'm
Morphing into an immortal coming through the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.940
portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.720
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme
for, you're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.700
cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.420
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future
just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.420
made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.430
pad
Singing to a man while they played piano

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.969
Man oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the
cable channel

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:23.219
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
the very next day, "Hey Fab

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:26.279
I'ma kill you!" lyrics coming at you at supersonic
speed (J.J. Fad)

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:29.029
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming
I'm a human, what I gotta do to get it through

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:31.300
to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.199
anything you say is ricocheting off of me
and it'll glue to you and

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.069
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating,
how to give a mothafucking audience a feeling

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:34.819
like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:39.310
waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off,

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.949
they'll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated,

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.580
I make elevating music, you make elevator
music

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.409
"Oh, he's too mainstream," well, that's what
they do when they get jealous, they confuse

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.939
it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, cause I found

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:50.319
a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc, throw on "Lose

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.270
Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that,

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.180
I don't know what words to use"
Let me know when it occurs to you while I'm

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.060
ripping any one of these verses, that versus
you

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.949
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you,
how many verses I gotta murder to

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.050
Prove that if you were half as nice, your
songs you could sacrifice virgins to?

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.639
School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.159
me, full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.729
my mind to, and I'm a million leagues above
you

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.210
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still
tongue in cheek, fuck you

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.509
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel,
I'm asleep in the front seat

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.569
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz "Still chunky
but funky"

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.069
But in my head there's something I can feel
tugging and struggling

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.249
Angels fight with devils and here's what they
want from me

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.699
They're asking me to eliminate some of the
women hate, but if you take into consideration

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.949
the bitter hatred
I had Then you may be a little patient and

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.569
more sympathetic to the situation and understand
the discrimination

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.029
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make
lemonade then

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.360
But if I can't batter the women, how the fuck
am I supposed to bake them a cake then?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.400
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.629
be overseas and take a vacation
To trip abroad and make her fall on her face

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.379
and
Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:59.269
Why be a king when you can be a god?
